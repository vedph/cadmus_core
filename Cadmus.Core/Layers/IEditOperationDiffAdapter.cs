/// diffing the two versions of the raw base text before and after changes
/// in it, and combining the resulting diff operations with the coordinates
/// system underlying each layer part. The final outcome is a set of
/// edit operations which describe how each targeted text atom was affected
/// by text editing. This atom varies according to the text part: e.g. it may
/// be a token in token-based text parts, or a tile in tiled-text parts.
